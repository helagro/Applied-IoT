# Tutorial on how to build a automation system for IKEA Tradfri

**Author:** Henrik Lagrosen, (hl223qb)

**Overview:**

This tutorial will show you how to set up a Raspberry Pico W to provide more automation abilities to the Ikea Tradfri system. The resulting system will be able to automate Tradfri commands based on data from the sensors connected to one or more Pico W's. The available sensors to use are a temperature sensor, a humidity sensor, a light sensor and a motion sensor.

![System Overview](res/img/IoT-diagram.jpg)

As shown above, it consists of a Raspberry Pico W, a server running Python and a Tradfri gateway. The Pico W is used to control the Tradfri devices and to send data to the server. The server is used to manage the data and to communicate with the Tradfri gateway. This is designed to be a fun hobby project, which could also result in an actually useful end-product. I think it is suitable for beginners in the field, but be careful with the hardware. **I claim no responsibility for any damages made to anything, regardless of cause.**

**Time Investment:**

All the software is already written, so the time investment is mostly in setting up the hardware and the software. The hardware should not take long, as all it takes is to follow the wiring diagram. The time required to setup the software is depends a lot on experience and luck. With a solid amount of programing and installing experience and no issues, it wouldn't take more than 45 minutes with nothing pre-installed. If you are new to programing and installing, it could take up to 2 hours. If you run into issues, it could take even longer. In total I would estimate 1.5 - 3.5 hours to setup the entire project, depending on experience and luck.

## Objective

- [ ] What do you want to do with the data?

**Project Selection Decision:**

I have some previous experience with developing software integrating with the IKEA Tradfri product line. Those projects were aimed to 
extend the existing functionallity of the smart home system and were highly tailored to suit my own needs. I learned that it was both
fun and easy to work with the Tradfri system and as it fitted well with the requirements of the course, I decided to build a project
that works as an extension to the Tradfri system.

**Purpose:**

This project aims to be a IoT project that other people can use or build upon. Being a popular product line, I can see others finding 
benefit in this project, both in learning and also for the practical use of the end product.

**Possible Insights:**

There are some aspects of the project that are newer to me. I have not made tutorials of this kind and I think that some of the data-visualisation tools will be new to me as well. I expect to learn more about both areas and how to operate with them more efficiently.
I think I will learn more about how to convey the instructions in a clear and concise way, and also how to make the project more appealing and
understandable to the reader.

## Computer setup

**My IDE choice:**

The IDE I chose for working with this project is Visual Studio Code. The most major factors behind the decision were the extendability of the code editor which allows for fine tuning the editor to my liking, and because I have a lot of previous experience with the editor. You can use whichever editor you prefer, but the instructions will be tailored to Visual Studio Code with the PyMakr plugin.

**Setting up Visual Studio Code:**

First, you need to install Node.js, using instructions available on [this page](https://nodejs.org/en/). This is needed for the PyMakr plugin to function. Then, you need to install Visual Studio Code from [this page](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download). After installing the editor, you can install the PyMakr plugin by searching for it in the extensions tab. 

**Setting up the Pico W:**

To be able to deploy MicroPython code on the the Pico W, you need to first flash the MicroPython firmware to the device. Start by connecting the Pico W to a micro USB cable. While holding the BOOTSEL button, connect the other end of the cable to your computer. After connected, you can release the BOOTSEL button and the Pico W should appear as a USB drive on your computer. You can then download the MicroPython firmware from [this](https://micropython.org/download/RPI_PICO_W/) page, and copy the .uf2 file onto the Pico W drive. After this, the Pico W should automatically install and disconnect from you computer, after which you can unplug the cable. The pico W is now ready to run MicroPython code, which can be done by connecting it to the computer again, opening the PyMakr menu in Visual Studio Code, selecting ADD DEVICES and then selecting the Pico W from the list of available devices. Then press the connect button on the device entry, and also the `Start Development Mode` button on the project. Everytime you save a file in the RP2 directory now, the code will be uploaded to the Pico W. Some of the variables could not be uploaded to the repository, so you need to add them yourself. You need to create a file in `Applied-IoT/RP2/lib` called `env.py`. In this file, you need to add the following variables:
`
```python
WIFI_SSID="" # The name of your WiFi network
WIFI_PASS="" # The password to your WiFi network
BROKER_ADDRESS="" # The IP address of the machine on which you want to run the server
BROKER_PORT=1883 # The port on which the MQTT broker is running, default is 1883
DEVICE_ID=1 # A unique identifier for the Pico W, used for triggering automations based on values from specific sensor-devices. Must be unique for each Pico W in the system, and must be a positive integer.
DISABLED_SENSORS="" # A comma separated list of sensors to disable. The available sensors are "motion", "temperature", "light" and "button". For instance, "motion,light" would disable the motion and light sensors.
```

**Setting up the local server:**

The server is used to coordinate the Pico W devices (in case there are multiple in your setup), to communicate with the Tradfri gateway and to manage the data. The server needs to be Linux based, but it can be a laptop for instance. In my case, I used a Raspberry Pi 4 running Raspbian. To setup the server, you need to install Python 3, for instance from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). The server uses the [pytradfri](https://github.com/home-assistant-libs/pytradfri) library. The library the [libcoap](https://github.com/obgm/libcoap) utility to communicate with the Tradfri gateway. This utility can be installed with [this script](https://github.com/home-assistant-libs/pytradfri/blob/master/script/install-coap-client.sh). To use it, you need to open a terminal at the directory where the file has been downloaded to. This can be done using the [cd](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/cd.1p.html) command. After that, run the following commands:

```bash
chmod 777 install-coap-client.sh
sudo ./install-coap-client.sh
```

The server also uses some python libraries. To install these, enter into the backend directory of the project and run either of the following commands, depending on your python installation:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
or
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
If you don't know which to use, try both üòÅ.

The server also needs a file called .env in the `backend` directory. This file should contain the following variables:

```bash
TRADFRI_IP="" # The IP address of the Tradfri gateway
```

To run the server, you can use one of the following commands, depending on your python installation:

```bash
python3 app.py
```
or
```bash
python app.py
```
If you don't know which to use, try both üòÅ. The server should now be running on port 5000 of your device. You can access the frontend by going to `http://localhost:5000/static/index.html` in your browser. You can also access it from other devices on the same network by replacing `localhost` with the IP address of the server.

## Putting everything together

![Wiring](res/img/Wiring.png)


**Electrics:**

Due to the choice of components, this entire setup require no additional resistors. The light sensor has a seperate pin for reading, and the push button has built-in resistors. The DHT11, button and light sensor all perform fine when powered with 3.3V. The motion sensor requires 5V power, but you can draw that from the USB input using the VBUS pin. Without it, the signal becomes highly irregular and random. This is not ideal as this bypasses features of the Pico W, like voltage regulation, overvoltage protection and backfeeding protection. An example of backfeeding is if you instead of drawing power from the VBUS, you accidentally power it. **This can cause damage to the device that the Pico is connected to (for instance, your expensive computer üò≥).** This is one part of the design which makes it unsuitable for production, but it is fine for a home project. 

**Production:**

For a production setup, an external power module supply should be used, together more optimised wiring, pin usage and preferably a case of sorts. A case could quite easily be 3D printed, improving both looks, dust protection, ease of directing sensors and durability. 

**Color coding:**

The diagram's wires are color coded, and I would recommend you do that too if possible. Red means power, black means ground and yellow means signal, i.e. where the data is read from.

**Breadboard layout:**

This breadboard works by having the two outer rows (blue and red), be connected like a row, meaning that all the pins in the blue rows use the same ground, and all the pins in the red row use the same power. The other pin-holes are connected by columns, meaning that all the pins in the same column are connected.

## The code

The code below is the main loop of the Pico W. It is responsible for polling the sensors at the specified intervals, and for sending the data to the server if a new value is registered. It uses the four polling functions `pollMotion`, `pollTemp`, `pollLight` and `pollBtn` to get the sensor data. The `MAIN_POLL_INTERVAL` is delay between each iteration of the loop. The button is polled at every iteration, as responsiveness is prioritised and no noise is expected. The other sensors are polled at a lower frequency, by using counter variables to keep track of how many iterations have passed since the last poll. If the counter reaches the specified maximum value, the sensor is polled and the counter is reset.

```python
while True:
    if(motionCounter >= motionCounterMax):
        pollMotion()
        motionCounter = 0

    if(tempCounter >= tempCounterMax):
        pollTemp()
        tempCounter = 0

    if(lightCounter >= lightCounterMax):
        pollLight()
        lightCounter = 0

    pollBtn()

    time.sleep(MAIN_POLL_INTERVAL)

    # Increment counters
    motionCounter += 1
    tempCounter += 1
    lightCounter += 1
```

The following code snippet shows one of the polling functions, `pollMotion`. It is responsible for polling the motion sensor and sending the data to the server if a new value is registered. The `prevMotion` variable is used to keep track of the previous value of the sensor, so that the server is not spammed with messages if the sensor value does not change. The `sensors.doesDetectMotion()` function is the function that actually reads the binary value of the associated pin. The data is published to the MQTT broker, under the topic `motion/{deviceID}`. The `deviceID` is a unique identifier for the Pico W, which is used for triggering automations based on values from specific sensor-devices.

```python
def pollMotion() -> None:
    global prevMotion
    detectsMotion = sensors.doesDetectMotion()

    if prevMotion == detectsMotion: return

    if detectsMotion:
        client.publish(f"motion/{deviceID}", "True")
    else:
        client.publish(f"motion/{deviceID}", "False")

    prevMotion = detectsMotion
```

This code snippet shows the `getTemperature` function, which is used to poll the temperature sensor. The function first checks if the sensor is disabled, by checking if the sensor is in the list of disabled sensors. This list is specified in an environment file, and makes it easy for any user to only use a subset of the compatible sensors. If the sensor is not disabled, the function will attempt to measure the temperature. If the measurement is successful, the temperature is returned. If the measurement fails, the function will print an error message and return `None`.

```python
def getTemperature() -> float | None:
    if "temperature" in getDisabledSensors():
        return None
    try:
        tempSensor.measure()
        return tempSensor.temperature()
    except Exception as error:
        print("E-1", error)
        return None
```

This code does not reside on the Pico W, but instead on the server. It is used to execute an action on a tradfri device. This function is called after an automation is triggered, and all arguments will come from that automation object. There are three available actions: `SET_STATE`, `TEMPORARY_ON` and `TOGGLE`. The `SET_STATE` action is used to set the state of a device to a specific value. The `TEMPORARY_ON` action is used to turn a device on for the specified amount of time. This could be useful in combination with the motion sensor, maybe turning a light on for a few minutes when motion is detected. It uses a hashmap of timers to make sure too similar timers are not created, for instance if three different motion detectors triggers the automation, it won't try to turn off the tradfri device three times when the time runs out. The `TOGGLE` action is used to toggle the state of a device. If the device is on, it will be turned off, and vice versa.

```python 
def execute(deviceID: int, action: int, payload: any) -> None:
    device = getDevice(deviceID)
    deviceControl = getDeviceControl(device)

    print("Executing action:", action, "with payload:", payload, "on device:", device)

    if action == Action.SET_STATE:
        api(deviceControl.set_state(payload))

    elif action == Action.TEMPORARY_ON:
        if(timers.get(deviceID)):
            timers[deviceID].cancel()

        api(deviceControl.set_state(True))
        timer = threading.Timer(payload, lambda: afterTemporaryOn(deviceID, deviceControl))
        timer.start()
        timers[deviceID] = timer

    elif action == Action.TOGGLE:
        if device.has_light_control:
            api(deviceControl.set_state(not deviceControl.lights[0].state))
        elif device.has_socket_control:
            api(deviceControl.set_state(not deviceControl.sockets[0].state))
        elif device.has_blind_control:
            api(deviceControl.set_state(not deviceControl.blinds[0].state))
        else:
            raise PytradfriError(f"E-7: Device {device.id} has no valid control")
        

    else:
        raise PytradfriError(f"E-5: Invalid action {action}")
```

## Transmitting the data / connectivity

**Wireless protocols and traffic:**

WiFi is used as the main wireless protocol for the system. The Pico W uses it to send new sensor data to the server, during the specific polling intervals used for each sensor, if a different value is registered. The shortest possible frequency data is sent is <TODO> and it could be an unlimited amount of time between messages if no new sensor data is recorded. 

**Transport protocols:**

MQTT is used as the transport protocol between the Pico W and the server. Given that the MQTT broker is running on the same device as the server, that end of the traffic never leaves the device. The server then uses the pytradfri library to communicate with the Tradfri gateway, which uses the CoAP protocol. The server also uses a REST API to communicate with the frontend over HTTP. The web API is built using the Python Flask library, communicating with the Flutter client application. The server also hosts a web version of the client application, also served over HTTP.

**Design choices:**

There was not a lot of constraints guiding which wireless protocol was to be used. All devices for the project are meant to be inside the users home, meaning that range was not an issue. The user would likely power the Pico W from the outlet directly, so power consumption was not a great concirn either. Despite network speed or latency not being a high priority, WiFi still seemed like a great choice. The Pico W has built in WiFi capabilities, meaning that no extra antenna or similar equipment would be neccessary, reducing cost. Bluetooth could still have been an alternative but the range could have been an issue. Bluetooth would have required the server and Pico W to be close to eachother, but with WiFi, they could be far apart, as long as the WiFi has good enough range. This could be achieved with a Mesh network, for instance. Both Bluetooth Low Energy and LoRa can be configured to be very power efficient, but within a home setting, the power consumption of WiFi is not a big issue.

## Presenting the data

> Describe the presentation part. How is the dashboard built? How long is the data preserved in the database?

**UI walk-through**

> img

The automations screen displays all created automations. On a large screen, it displays most of the details of it, otherwise just a list of their names. Each item is clickable, and will take you to a page for editing them. There is also a plus button in the bottom right corner, allowing the user to create a new automation, taking them to the the same editing page but for a new item instead.

> img

The settings screen is used for specifying the url of the server. It should be in the format http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:5000

> img

The automations editing screen is used to create or edit an automation. It has a number of fields for specifing the details of the automation. Most of them should be self-explanatory. The `Value` field is used to specify the value that the sensor value will be compared against. The input type is a decimal number. The `Button` and `Motion` sensors will produce a value of `1` when they are triggered and `0` when they are not. For instance, if you want to trigger an automation when the motion sensor detects motion, you would set the `Sensor` to `MOTION`, the `Comparison` field to `EQUAL` and the `Value` field to `1`.

There are three available actions to invoke on the chosen Tradfri device. The `SET_STATE` action is used to turn the device on or off. The device will turn on if the `Payload` is `1` and off if the `Payload` is `0`. The `TEMPORARY_ON` action is used to turn the device on for the amount of seconds entered in the `Payload` field. After that, it will turn off. Could be useful if you want a light to be on when motion has been detected the last five minutes, etc. The `TOGGLE` action is used to toggle the state of the device. If the device is on, it will be turned off, and vice versa. The `Payload` value is ignored for this action.

The `Sensor Device` field is used to specify which sensor device the automation should apply to. The value should match the value entered into the `env.py` for the desired Pico W.

## Finalizing the design

**Reflections:**

I think the project went well overall. I completed the MVP very early due to anticlipated future time constraints, which helped me in chosing a suitable scope for the project. The main downside of this was low initial code quality, causing time expensive bugs and refactoring. I do maintain that in my particular circumstance, it was the right strategy, even though it caused some issues. The main improvement potential I noticed was to be more careful about data types in weakly typed languages. Python won't complain during runtime if a variable stores a value different to the one I described in the type hint. This caused some bugs and issues which took longer than it should have to solve. I ended up checking for data type in if-statements, scattered across the code. Ideally, I should have done this earlier and more deliberately.
